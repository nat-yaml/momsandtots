      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Family Place is a registered charity dedicated to supporting children aged 0-6 and their caregivers. We offer a wide range of services, including drop-in play, educational programs, and social and recreational activities.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Our facility features two spacious playrooms, engaging crafts, and a welcoming environment where children and caregivers can connect and grow together. We also provide hot lunches and a variety of programs designed to support both children and those who care for them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
